# Duplicate Detection using LSH and a varying number of Hash functions

This project tries to dermine duplicate products from different web shops using LSH as pre-selection tool for MSM. In this project the amount of hash functions was varied to see the effect on performance. Firs the data is cleaned, than LSH is used, then clustering is done based on MSM and finally the metrics of 5 different bootstraps are calculated. The data used are listings of TV's containing titles, Key-Value Pairs and ModelID's for evaluation.

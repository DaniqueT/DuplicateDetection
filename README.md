# Duplicate Detection using LSH and a varying number of Hash functions

This project tries to determine duplicate products from different webshops using LSH as pa re-selection tool for MSM. In this project, the amount of hash functions was varied to see the effect on performance. First, the data is cleaned, then LSH is used, after this clustering is done based on MSM and finally, the metrics of 5 different bootstraps are calculated. The data used are listings of TVs containing titles, Key-Value Pairs and ModelIDs for evaluation.
